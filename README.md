## Usage

```
npm install -g generator-make-it-happen
```

Then run the debug server:

```
grunt debug
```

The development build will be created in `build/dev`. NOTE: files in the `build` directory should never be modified, 
as they will be overwritten whenever the grunt task is run. Make all modifications in `src`.

To build a minified version of the app for distribution, run the 'build' grunt task:

```
grunt build
```

The build will be created in `build/dist`.

## Roadmap

Planned features in rough order of priority:

* Unit tests for generator
* Unit testing framework(s) for app
* Image (PNG/GIF/JPG/SVG) minification
* Sprite generation
* JSHint Javascript linter
* Choice of Underscore or Lodash
* Bacon.model?
* Backbone option?
* Jekyll?
